# CS101-Final-Project
This was the final project I made for CS 101. The game's starter code was given, and then I made 3 modifications to it, as was required in by the assignment.

To run the project, one first needs to download simplecpp. The instructions for downloading simplecpp can be found [here](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ranade/simplecpp/).

Once simplecpp is installed on your system, all you have to do is download and unzip the game into a folder of your choice and then run make. The game will automatically compile. After that, running `./lasso` on the terminal will run the game.

README.txt contains a short description of the game and how it works, because it was required as a part of the project. Once you run the game, it shows you instructions and then asks you to press `s` to start the game.
