Welcome to the Lasso Game!

In this game, the objective is to catch as many coins as you can! (But beware
the bombs, because catching them makes you lose 1 point!) The golden circles
are coins, and the black circles are bombs.

y : yank the Lasso
l : loop the Lasso
q : quit the game

[ : rotate the Lasso counter-clockwise
] : rotate the Lasso clockwise
= : increase the speed of the Lasso
